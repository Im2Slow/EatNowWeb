# EatNowWeb

As a part of our 2nd year's project in ESILV engineering school, we are currently building a website to allow our students/teachers to order food around our school located in La DÃ©fense, FRANCE.

We have signed a charter with other project teams in order to share a common database (on https://phpmyadmin.cluster020.hosting.ovh.net/)
and FTP accesses to the same server (on ftp:\\ftp.cluster020.hosting.ovh.net

We coudn't set a real payment procedure because we need to have parternships with the banks, but we're aiming for a Paypal simulator in short term.
